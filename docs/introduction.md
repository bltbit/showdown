# Introduction

My name is Ben and I made this course.

In it, I teach you relevant and marketable skills using a hands-on approach. It's meant to be fun, educational, and to give you exposure to the kind of thinking that can make you a successful, employable programmer for years to come.

The tools and technologies I've chosen for this course are what I consider to be the finest represnetations of the current art of programming. The approaches I take are mostly the same as what I would take if I were building a real-world application. In a few cases, I take "the long way" in the interests of teaching and completeness; but I try not to even get into a situation where there is a difference. Hopefully, I can present a course where you learn by doing the exact same thing I would do in a real situation.

And the best way to do that? Create a real situation!
