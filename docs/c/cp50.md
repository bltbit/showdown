## Review

Wow! You just learned how to edit sounds like a pro, which basically means you can create your own sounds now. You also learned how to play sounds in response to user actions. You learned where to find free sounds. It's been a pretty good day.

## Bonus Mission

Do you own a gun or several? Go squeeze off a few rounds this weekend and record it. Record other gun sounds too, like various clicks and reloading. Then, upload it to Freesounds and add a section to our `readme.md` under a heading of "Original Student Sounds". Send a pull request! If you do this and it's a clean recording, I'll give you 1 year of `idkfa` on [BitBlt Patron](https://www.patreon.com/bltbit).
