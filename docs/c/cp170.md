## Objectives

- Limit the total number of reloads and bullets.

## Tools

-

## Create your branch

```
git checkout -b my-checkpoint-170 my-checkpoint-160
```

## Steps

- Decide how many times the person can reload (ie, total bullets)
- Track `bulletsRemaining` state
- Wrap `handleReload` in a callback to track state var changes
- Implement bullet math calcs
- Byproduct: can reload without being empty

## Commit, Push, and Compare

- Questions or problems? [Report an issue](https://github.com/bltbit/showdown/issues) to the Showdown repository.

## Review

The gun architecture we set up in previous steps made this change easy. We simply needed to expand its intelligence to track total number of bullets and only add bullets if there were some reamining.
