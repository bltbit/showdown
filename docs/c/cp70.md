## Objectives

- Make the gunshot sound more responsive on mobile devices

## Create your branch

```
git checkout -b my-checkpoint-70 my-checkpoint-60
```

## Steps

- `npm run ngrok`
- Tap mobile device screen to hear gunshot
- Notice that there is a slight (usually 300ms) delay between the tap and the sound. We can do better!
- This is a somewhat infamous problem
- Move to `onTouchStart`

## Review

You just learned the difference between `onClick` and `onTouchStart`. While `onClick` might be fine for a lot of purposes, only `onTouchStart` can give the instant feedback we need in a game.
