## Objectives

- Add a "snack tray" showing how many bullets we have
- Learn a little more CSS kung fu
- Learn a little more about what the Chrome debugger can do for you
- Learn to design visual game assets using Gimp
- Learn to find open source visual game assets
- Learn how to create sub components in React

## Tools

- Gimp
- imagemin
- glob

## Create your branch

```
git checkout -b my-checkpoint-120 my-checkpoint-110
```

## Steps

- Search https://www.pngguru.com/search?png=chamber+revolver for suitable images
- I really love https://www.pngguru.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-epbjj
- Open with Gimp
- Resize to 100x100
- Verify canvas size is square (it is)
- Demonstrate arbitrary angle transform in Gimp to show that the cylinder rotates cleanly
  - Notice how light rotates with the cylinder. To solve this, we would need:
    - Original image as layers
    - Without light source
    - Add a quasi-light source using CSS
    - Too hard for this step, let's just go with what we have. Maybe it'll look cool anyway.
- Export
- Create `package.json` script for `imagemin-cli`
- Update the base64 encoder to save both audio and image data in base64 format
- Create a `<div>` block with red background styling to be the snack tray
  - use `position:absolute` and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `width`, `height` to position the tray where you want it
  - add a nice rounded border using `border-radius` and `border-color` attributes
- Add the revolver image we generated
  - this will need to be a component that comes from `useRevolver`
  - convert to `index.tsx`
  - add css styling to size and contain it

## Review

This is a good example of an intermediate step, or a proof of concept step. Sometimes called a "spike", we roughed out how we might want the snack tray and revolver cylinder to look.
