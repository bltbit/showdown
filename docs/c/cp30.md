# 30 - Your First Pull Request

http://github.com/bltbit/showdown/tree/checkpoint-30

## Objectives

- Promote your web app URL in **BitBlt's Showdown List**

## Tools

- Github pull request feature

## Steps

- `git checkout -b my-checkpoint-30 checkpoint-30`
- Add your github username and Firebase URL to the bottom of `showdowns.json`
  - Since your project is not live yet, set `isLive` to `false`
  - Set `githubUsername` to your github username
  - Set a `logoUrl`. `<yourFirebaseUrl>/assets/icon/favicon.png` is a good option. If you omit this, we will use your github avatar.
  - Set a `title` to whatever you named your game. I named mine `Showdown`.
  - **[Optional]** Set `patreonUsername` if you are a [BitBlt Patron](https://www.patreon.com/bltbit). Your game will get additional promotion in this repo and on BitBlt channels after you set `isLive` to `true`.
- Commit and push your changes
- Go to your github repo URL and you will see a `Create Pull Request` button. Press it.
  - For the base branch, choose `master`

## Review

How awesome are you!! You just legitimately made a contribution to an open source project. Put that on your resume. Seriously, you just forked a repo, made a change, and sent a pull request. That's a huge flex!
